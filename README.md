ABOUT CUSTOMIZED VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM:

1) In this project I emulate all data structures which are used by operating system to manage file system oriented asks.
2) As the name suggests its virtual because I maintain all the records in primary storage (RAM).
3) In this project I create all data structures which required for file subsystems as : FT, UAREA, UFDT, SB, DILB, DB etc.
4) I provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of file subsystem as : Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.
5) While creating this project all above functionality I use our own data structures by referring algorithms of UNIX Operating System.
6) By using this project I can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.
